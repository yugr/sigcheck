= What is this? =

Sigtester is a small proof-of-concept tool for detecting
unsafe signal handlers.

The tool works by preloading a DSO (libsigtester.so) to a process.
The DSO intercepts all (!) libc functions. The interceptors check
whether they run in unsafe context.

The tool is rather hacky but it was able to detect potential errors
in popular programs (zip, aspell).

= Usage =

Preload the tool into your app and send it a signal.
The latter can be automated by setting SIGTESTER_FORK_TESTS
environment variable to non-zero value.

For debugging, set SIGTESTER_VERBOSE. To reduce the amount
of clutter, use SIGTESTER_MAX_ERRORS.

For some examples, see scripts/examples.

= Build =

To build the tool, simply run ./build.sh from project top directory.

= Test =

To test the tool, simply run scripts/test.sh from project top directory.

= TODO =

Various TODOs are scattered all over the codebase.

One big thing is running complete distribution with this
(by putting libsigtester.so to /etc/ld.so.preload).
